# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pandas Compilation Error
**Problem**: pandas 2.1.4 was incompatible with Python 3.13, causing C compilation errors during deployment.

**Solution**: 
- Removed pandas from `requirements.txt`
- Updated all UI files to work without pandas
- Replaced `pd.DataFrame()` with native Python data structures
- Updated download buttons to use JSON format instead of CSV

### 2. packages.txt Parsing Error
**Problem**: Comments in `packages.txt` were causing apt-get parsing errors.

**Solution**: 
- Removed all comments from `packages.txt`
- Left file empty since no system packages are needed for the demo

### 3. Requirements Optimization
**Problem**: Old requirements file with heavy dependencies was still being used.

**Solution**: 
- Streamlined `requirements.txt` to only essential packages:
  - streamlit>=1.28.0
  - plotly>=5.15.0
  - streamlit-option-menu>=0.3.2
  - python-dotenv>=1.0.0

### 4. Entry Point Configuration
**Problem**: Streamlit Cloud needed proper entry point configuration.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `streamlit_app.py` as the main entry point
- Properly configured path imports for UI modules
